        <h3>FOOT BRIDGE, KRKONOŠE</h3>
        <h3>Appearance and Construction of the Footbridge​</h3>
        <p>The appearance and construction of this footbridge naturally stem from its location and specific conditions. The design of the footbridge over the Renner Stream was significantly influenced by the requirement for its drivability, which led to the widening of the cross-section to 3.3 meters at its narrowest point and the use of massive structural elements. Despite the challenges in design, this construction allowed for easier transportation of the footbridge to its final position. This made it possible to use a structural element that spans the entire seven-meter gap between the stone pylons on either side of the Renner Stream. The load-bearing elements consist of steel pressed „U“ profiles with a total length of 8 meters, covering 7 meters of the stream‘s width and 0.5 meters of placement on the pylons on both sides.</p>
        
        <h3>Integration of Bench and Footbridge​</h3>
        <p>In the initial concepts, a minimalist bench was placed at the edge of the footbridge, allowing tourists to enjoy the view of the valley through which the stream flows. As the design evolved, the bench grew in size and became integrated into the footbridge, eventually merging both elements into a single shape and structure. The footbridge is oriented towards the most beautiful view, offering a glimpse through the valley onto the densely forested surrounding hills. The curve of the right side of the footbridge changes and adapts analogously to the contours of the valley formed by the stream. This allows users to comfortably sit on the edge of the footbridge or almost lie down at the widest point of the cross-section, without intruding on the driveable width of the footbridge.</p>

        <h3>MUNICIPAL LIBRARY, PRACHATICE</h3>
        <h3>Context and Site</h3>
        <p>The site is located in close proximity to the historic core of Prachatice. Throughout the design process, it was essential to consider the presence of such a complex, self-contained area and to engage with the context of the territory. We are heavily influenced by the heritage conservation area. We do not, cannot, and do not want to encroach upon the designated park area. Štěpánka Park is on the verge of reconstruction, but for now, it remains in a deplorable state, lacking purpose.</p>

        <h3>Avoiding the Fate of the Historic Center</h3>
        <p>In this project, I aim to avoid the same fate that has befallen the historic center of Prachatice. We circumvent the center instead of actively utilizing it. The historic core of the city functions as little more than a museum, serving no other purpose. Štěpánka Park currently lacks any practical use, becoming a similar museum piece. Therefore, we are adding functionality. We pass through the park to enter the library, thereby populating the park and making it safer.</p>
